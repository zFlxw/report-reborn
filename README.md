### Paper Project Template
This project is a template for paper projects, based on Mojang's [brigadier](https://github.com/Mojang/brigadier) commands. You can simply click generate a repository by using this template.

## How to use the paper api
Since this project is based on Mojang's [brigadier](https://github.com/Mojang/brigadier) commands, we cannot use only the paper api. Instead, we have to use the compiled sources.
To get the full paper sources, you have to complete the following step:

- Compile the jar file directly from the [source](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper#how-to-compiling-jar-from-source).

For me, this took up to 15 - 20 minutes. However, this can variate based on your pc and download speed.

After downloading/compiling the jar file, you simply have to put it into the `libs` folder.

## How to use this template
After generation an own repository using this template and compiling the paper sources, you can use this project. It's recommended to rename all placeholders like "YourPlugin" or "YourName" :)
